## Star Wars Role Playing Game

[Star Wars Game](https://mdhcodes.github.io/star-wars-rpg/)

### Directions:

* The player selects their character by clicking one of the four images displayed.

* All the other characters become enemies and are moved to the enemies div. The background-color of these images turns red.

* The player then selects an opponent by clicking a red image and that image is moved to the opponent div.

* At this time, the fight may begin. The player clicks the attack button to initiate the attack / counter attack sequence.

* When the player clicks attack, the opponent and the player lose health points.
These health points are displayed at the bottom of every image. The player continues to click the attack button until they win or their opponent wins.

* When the opponent's health points are reduced to zero or below, the opponent is removed from the game and the player must select a new opponent.

* The player wins the game by defeating all enemy characters.

* The player loses the game if their character's health points are reduced to zero or below.

### Attack / Counter Attack:

* The player's Attack Power increases after each attack button click if certain conditions are met. Attack Power increases by the player's initial Attack Power. So, if the character's Attack Power is 5, each attack will increase their Attack Power by 5 (10, 15, 20, 25, etc).

* The opponent may only use Counter Attack Power which never changes.
